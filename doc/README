GentMaint is a collection of bash scripts to aid the maintenance of a 
Gentoo Linux system. You should give them a good look before actually using 
them, and you're strongly discouraged from using them as cron jobs, even though 
that's what I designed (some of) them for ;-). They can be used under the 
conditions of version 3 of the GPL.  To download the GentMaint package, read the 
code documentation, or to contact the developer, see: 
http://gentmaint.sourceforge.net/



INSTALLATION:

Copy the scripts into a directory in your path, e.g. /usr/bin/ or /usr/local/sbin/
They should be executed as root.

Run  gentmaint-help  for a short description of each script
